      <p>
       I am currently in my final semester of school, eagerly working towards completing my degree. As a passionate student, I am dedicated to learning and improving as much as I can in the field of software engineering. 
       My goal is to constantly enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology.<br><br>

       Outside of academics, I have a deep love for Formula 1 racing, which fuels my excitement for innovation and precision. 
       I am also an avid gamer, enjoying the thrill and challenge of various gaming genres. 
       Additionally, I cherish spending time outdoors, embracing nature, and seeking adventure in the great outdoors.<br><br>

      Whether itâ€™s coding, racing, gaming, or exploring nature, I am driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to excel in everything I do.<br>
